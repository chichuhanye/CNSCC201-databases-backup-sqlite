# DatabaseBackup
A program in Java and using JDBC that takes a database and produces a textual “backup” of the contents. This textual backup consists of SQL statements that will recreate the contents of the original database i.e. CREATE TABLE and INSERT .. INTO instructions. The original database is recreated by using the text files that the program produces as input to SQLite. Access to schema information uses the appropriate JDBC methods.
